When we speak, we lengthen and acoustically expand some segments and words, and reduce others. Typically, the elements that are important or infrequent are expanded, and those that are obvious from context or occur often, reduced. In other words, we vary the elementâ€™s acoustic distinctiveness as its information content varies. The general aim of this project is to study how information is mapped onto speech signal variability. 

Our particular aim is to disentangle the impact of the various factors that influence acoustic distinctiveness, observed as phonetic reduction and expansion processes. The impact of probabilistic factors described above, that is of contextual predictability and frequency, is well evidenced (Jurafsky et al. 2002, Levy, 2008, Bybee and Scheibman 1999, Jurafsky et al. 2001, Haspelmath 2008). 

However, what remains unclear, is how probabilistic effects interact with a) prosodic covariates such as speech rate b) with the constraints of the language-specific prosodic system (Malisz et al. 2018; Cohen Priva 2017, Athanasopolou) and c) with discourse style in their impact on acoustic distinctiveness. Additionally, the question whether the relatively small magnitude of probabilistic effects is relevant perceptually has not been definitively answered yet (Jaeger and Buz, 2019).

Moreover, it appears that the way in which probabilistic factors are encoded phonetically differs across languages. The acoustic parameters that encode predictability in one language may not be susceptible to such effects in another language (Malisz et al. 2018). There are also cross-linguistic differences in the application of the mechanism depending on the prosodic system (Athanasopolou et al. 2017; Turnbull et al. 2015). Clearly, much remains to be studied with respect to how probabilistic effects, prosodic effects and prosodic systems relate to, and possibly interact with, one another and influence observable signal variability. Our aim is therefore, to add to the growing number of studies that compare the above effects across languages by analysing Polish data. 

We will therefore fit statistical models (e.g. linear mixed effects) to analyse the impact of probabilistic, prosodic (e.g. speech rate) and frequency effects on such exponents of acoustic distinctiveness as duration, vowel dispersion, consonantal center of gravity, vocalic spectral emphasis etc. We will also introduce a discourse style variable by comparing effects in two paired datasets: read and spontaneous speech.

Methodologically, the project depends on the careful estimation of the main variables: acoustic distinctiveness and probabilistic factors. Therefore, we need to build a high quality speech database in order to be able to extract acoustic parameters reliably. The project describes the standards we set for such a database. Acoustic parameters will be extracted semi-automatically from the speech database. We will also train state-of-the-art neural network language models on large text corpora.  Probabilistic measures, such as surprisal, are estimated from such language models. 

Our results are going to contribute to resolving such problems as the interaction of prosodic systems with probabilistic effects on speech as well as their impact on perception.
